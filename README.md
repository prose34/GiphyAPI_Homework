# GiphyAPI_Homework

Input a gif to search for in the input box. 

When the user clicks on the submit button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
